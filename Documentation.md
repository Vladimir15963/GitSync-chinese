## Sync Mechanisms

- Clicking the quick tile will trigger a sync (in the same way as the in-app sync button)

### When app opened or closed

- Enable the auto sync feature
    - This will prompt you to enable the `Git Sync Accessibility Service`
    - This service is used to watch for the selected app being opened and closed (ignoring keyboards)
    - No data is collected or stored
- Select an application to watch
- Turn on/off sync on application opened or closed


### From custom intent (advanced)

- You can trigger a sync using a custom intent (e.g. from Tasker or other automation apps)
- Intent details
    - Target: `Service`
    - Package: `com.viscouspot.gitsync`
    - Class: `com.viscouspot.gitsync.GitSyncService`
    - Action: `INTENT_SYNC`

## Resolve Merge Conflicts

### When a merge conflict occurs in your repository
- A notification is sent to the device
- Sync methods other than `Force Push` and `Force Pull` are disabled
- A `MERGE CONFLICT` entry is added to the recent commits

### Clicking on the `MERGE CONFLICT` entry will
- Take you to the resolution dialog
- Allow you to navigate between conflicts using the arrows
- Allow you to decide which changes to keep and discard
- Allow you to open any conflicting file in an editor for more control
